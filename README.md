### RUN

1. `docker-compose up -d`

2. `composer install`

3. `vendor/bin/phinx migrate -e development`
    ` // vendor/bin/phinx rollback -e development`

4. `vendor/bin/phinx seed:run -e production`


### What is the purpose of the exercise?
To evaluate your skills in the following areas:

Setting up a small PHP project, ideally without major usage of a bundled framework, but instead usage of composer packages when needed. Any framework components can be used separately via Composer as well.
Setting up a basic MySQL database & database migration query for a single table database, connected to an ORM package, and developing a basic CRUD application, connected to a standard RESTful JSON API
HTTP connection to 3rd party API using good practices via Guzzle
Following general PSR standards and good code documentation & commenting 

### Exercise Description:
Please code a RESTful API to store, retrieve, delete, update phone book items.
Each phone book item should have at least the following fields:

- First name (required)
- Last name
- Phone number (required) - must be validated based on some standard, e.g. +12 223 444224455
- Country code - country code should be validated via https://api.hostaway.com/countries
- Timezone name - should be validated via https://api.hostaway.com/timezones
- insertedOn (required) - DateTime type
- updatedOn (required) - DateTime type

In every insert or update, a call should be sent to the given API endpoints to get list of countries or timezones for validation, and proper error should be thrown if itâ€™s invalid
Exceptions should be handled properly, specially upon validation or HTTP call issues
Different layers of application shall be separated when necessary
Proper design patterns shall be used when necessary 
Results should be possible to be retrieved by ID, or as total results, or by searching parts of the name

#### In order to show your skills and get ahead of other candidates, you can work on one or many of the following bonus items:
- Bonus 1: you can implement pagination in the RESTful API result, which includes total result, support for number of items per     page, and offset
- Bonus 2: add OAuth 2 authentication for accessing the CRUD endpoints
- Bonus 3: you can also add logging of the errors, and caching of external API calls
- Bonus 4: if you have a working code on Vagrant with proper provisioning script, we appreciate it


Tip: we are using Phalcon framework (https://phalconphp.com/en/), and we love The PHP League products (https://thephpleague.com), so feel free using them in your project :)
